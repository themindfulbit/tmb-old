## About the Author

{{ theme:partial src="image" file="erik-lso.jpg" }}

My name is Erik Hess and I'm a a web designer, illustrator and part-time fighter pilot living in Carson City, NV. I've got a a BSFS in Science, Technology and International Affairs from Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service, but I can't say I've used it for its intended purpose.

I received a commission as an Ensign in the US Navy in 1997 via NROTC and earned my Wings of Gold in 1999. In the following years I completed two combat deployments, flying first the F-14 Tomcat then the F/A-18F Super Hornet. In 2007 and 2008 I was lucky enough to wave the first-ever arrestments of the French Rafale and Boeing EA-18G aboard a US Navy aircraft carrier.

In 2010, I left active duty as Force Landing Signal Officer for the Navy’s Atlantic Fleet to work full-time as partner and Chief Designer of [high90](http://high90.com) a web development company I founded with Bob van der Clay in 2005. I'm also co-founder and Director of Training at [Carrier Landing Consultants, LLC](http://carrierlandingconsultants.com), the world’s only (and also the world's least-busy) Landing Signal Officer and Carrier Operations consulting firm.

I have the privilege to continue serving as a pilot in the US Navy reserves, where I pretend to be a bad guy in the F-5N Tiger II.

## About This Site

I created The Mindful Bit in late 2011 to look for an intersection of mindfulness, productivity, and technology. I'm trying to see the world of tech through a lens of its impermanent, emergent, and inherently unsatisfying nature. While I don’t have any good answers, I do think it’s possible to have enlightening conversations around the questions this crazy world throws at us.

I'm an [INFJ](http://www.personalitypage.com/INFJ.html), so [none of this](http://typelogic.com/infj.html) should be a real surprise.

Since its launch, I've posted a lot of flying stories and pictures, along with a few articles on technology and related fields. I'm still working on the mindfulness part and probably will be for the rest of my life.

We are what we do, not what we claim to be. In that regard, this site is no exception.
