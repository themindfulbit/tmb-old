[Frida Ghitis](https://twitter.com/FridaGColumns) at CNN illuminates an unfortunate reality:

> North Korea's message seems to be: If you have nuclear capabilities, it doesn't matter how outrageously you behave; it doesn't matter how horribly you mistreat your people; it doesn't matter how flimsy your economy is.

> When you have a nuclear arsenal, countries that could topple your regime with a tiny fraction of their power suddenly become afraid of making you angry.

> This is a pernicious reality with tragic and hazardous consequences.

Iran is learning from our deeply contrasted approach to North Korea and Iraq: Once you acquire nuclear weapons&mdash;even without a credible means to deliver them&mdash;the threat of external regime change is greatly reduced. 

Will they be responsible stewards of this power?
