In the wide discussion surrounding Marco Arment's excellent post [Apple has Lost the Functional High Ground](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground) there seems to be fairly broad concurrence that Apple's software just doesn't seem as polished as it used to be. While Marco now [regrets](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/05/popular-for-a-day) some of the word choices in his original post, I don't think it would have traveled as far amongst those who care about Apple and its future if it didn't have at least a kernel of truth.

The "Apple is doomed" crowd has been wrong for long enough that we can safely ignore them. Apple is about as far from doomed as it can get right now, and that's their biggest problem.  

### A Thousand "No"s for Every "Yes"

As Apple itself reminded us in the video prelude to WWDC 2013, the number of projects they say no to is far larger than the number they go forward with. Maybe they aren't going far enough. Here are a few projects I believe Apple could safely step away from so they can focus on their core strength &ndash; making the finest hardware and operating systems on earth.

* iWork &ndash; It's an enjoyable alternative Office suite, but destroying backwards compatibility without providing an easily discoverable path forward isn't taking care of your users. iWork has failed to unseat Microsoft Office and Google Drive's preeminence even on its home platform, and I don't see that changing. Now that it's free, it doesn't even have a revenue model. 
* iCloud
* Maps
* Final Cut Pro and Logic
* iBooks
* iTunes and Beats
* iMessage and FaceTime
* AppleTV

Along with stepping back from the distractions above, Apple should get out of the way of the extraordinarily talented developers who make their platform shine. Give them all the tools they need to make incredible experiences on OS X and iOS, and stop tying their hands in the name of control. Here are some steps they could take in that direction.

* Keep the App Stores, but end the 30% cut.
* Help the iPad become something more than just a big iPod Touch
* Developer mode on iOS
