On this week's episode of [Generational](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/) I turned the tables on Gabe and got him to open up about his broken laptop, how he became a professional chemist, and why he gave it up for a career in IT.

Along the way we discussed childhood dreams, chemistry sets, growing up geeky, blowing things up, setting yourself on fire, learning what is and isn't deadly, the fear of looking stupid, and what happens when you achieve your goals and find you're no longer happy. 

If you want to know more about who Gabe is and how he got where he is today, [this is your show](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/5/4/033-what-happened-when-gabe-set-himself-on-fire.html).
