Gabe and I were thrilled to have Dr. Drang return to talk about his personal history with computing devices. We were also thrilled to release the show itself, which took us longer than usual (a few *months* longer than usual) to get out the door.

This is as good a time as any to talk about the show itself. We've been less than regular with our episode releases this summer, for good reason. Doing the show notes right takes *a long frickin' time*. Since quality show notes are kind of our "thing" on Technical Difficulties, we're faced with a couple of options: doing shows farther apart, or skimping on quality.

We've decided that releasing fewer, higher quality shows is the lesser evil.

The catch is, of course, that we really like podcasting. So rather than satisfy ourselves with intermittent releases, we've started recording another show called [Dawn Patrol](http://technicaldifficulties.us/dawn-patrol). Every Saturday the four of us (me, [Gabe](http://twitter.com/macdrifter), [Potatowire](http://twitter.com/potatowire), and [Bob](http://twitter.com/takitapart)) sit down ridiculously early in the morning and talk about whatever is on our minds. It's the unscripted counterpart to our regular show, and the tone (and show notes, thankfully) are very light.

We've also hinted a few times that we've got another show coming out. It's sort of the [mirror-universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Universe_(Star_Trek)) counterpart to Technical Difficulties, and it's called Heretics. We'll have more to say about Heretics very soon, but I think you'll like it.

Stay tuned.
