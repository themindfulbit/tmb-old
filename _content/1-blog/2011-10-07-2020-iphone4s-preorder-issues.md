I tried to preorder two new Verizon iPhone 4S phones through the online Apple Store this morning. I got all the way to the end before discovering you can't start a new Family Share plan via the Apple website but instead have to go into the store on October 14th.

On a whim, I tried the same order through verizonwireless.com and it went right through.

**Lesson:** If you're switching to Verizon from another carrier and need to set up more than one iPhone 4S on a Family Share plan - go to the carrier website, not apple.com
