[When Office Technology Overwhelms, Get Organized][1]

[David Allen][2] and his [Getting Things Done][3] [series][4] of [books][5] are essential productivity reading.

I remember when a friend introduced me to his first book on a cross-country trip to New Orleans. He was one of the most productive people I knew, and after reading the book I started to understand why.

David has just written what might as well be called a Five Minute GTD overview for the New York Times. I know I'm probably preaching to the choir, but if you've always wondered what this GTD thing is all about, it's a great start.
