[Paul Ford](https://twitter.com/ftrain) wrote an [amusing piece](https://medium.com/message/1ba60bdc32e7) the other day about the crimes-against-design which populate many military presentations. Some of the images in that piece take me right back to my good old days on active duty. 

Military presentations (and the graphics that often accompany them) have a well-deserved reputation for being [awful](http://www.wired.com/2010/08/u-s-officer-in-afghanistan-mows-down-powerpoint-rangers/?intcid=postnav), [inscrutable](http://www.wired.com/2010/09/revealed-pentagons-craziest-powerpoint-slide-ever/), or just plain [weird](/assets/img/ideas.jpg), especially by the appropriately high standards of Silicon Valley. There are several reasons for this, some of which are applicable to the outside world and some of which are purely a product of their environment.

First off, there just aren't that many design-oriented folks in government or military organizations. While I've had a ton of Navy friends with artistic talent &ndash; including some of the finest musicians and videographers I've ever met &ndash; a knack for visual design isn't considered a highly useful skill if you're on a path to a military career. Those who are compelled to practice it (like me, for better or worse) are often condemned to become *The PowerPoint Guy*. Eventually their inclinations lead them elsewhere.

Second, as a staff officer you're almost always working with an awful toolset. Keep in mind that (until very recently) most Navy workstations provide the following to an aspiring presentation architects:

* Windows XP
* Office 2003
* MS Paint

Yep. That's it. No special fonts (can't install 'em), no Photoshop or Illustrator (can't install 'em, couldn't afford it anyway). Given those limitations, I'm impressed these presentations aren't using more [Comic Sans](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670323/the-higgs-boson-announced-in-comic-sans-reveals-a-failing-of-modern-type).

Third, the military shares a misconception with the rest of the government and much of the business world that the slides should be able to act as a substitute for the speaker. While you'd think this would drive presentation designers towards clarity, it often does exactly the opposite, since diagrams with bulleted annotations will never be able to provide the clarity and fidelity of well-written prose supported by a few well-chosen graphics. 

*The illusion of clarity offered by these bulleted-lists are often far worse than the alternative.* Unfortunately, people are often scared by the messiness of reality. Bullet points help place things in safe, easily-digestible boxes. [Edward Tufte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte) provided the classic analysis of this topic in his essays [Visual and Statistical Thinking](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/ebooks) and [The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/ebooks). The first essay can also be found in his book [Visual Explanations](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Explanations-Quantities-Evidence-Narrative/dp/0961392126/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400335342&sr=1-1&keywords=visual+explanations) and the second in [Beautiful Evidence](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Evidence-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392177/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400334131&sr=8-1&keywords=beautiful+evidence+tufte).

Tufte primarily focuses on the [Challenger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster) and [Columbia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster) mishaps, but the lessons are broadly applicable. For a quick look at the second essay's key points, as well as some enlightening discussion around the topic, I highly recommend the [PowerPoint Does Rocket Science](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB) and [PowerPoint and Military Intelligence](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000fv&topic_id=1&topic=) threads on Tufte's site.

The fourth and probably most influential factor in most of these presentations is a lack of time. Anyone with project management experience knows that you seemingly never have enough time to polish any job as highly as you'd like it. Lack of time is often related to prioritization, and I can tell you firsthand that design isn't even on the list of a staff officer's priorities. That's unfortunate, given the importance of many of the issues discussed in these presentations. It's also completely understandable, given the ever expanding responsibilities shouldered as funding and manpower steadily shrink and requirements and expectations steadily grow.

The final factor in many of these design mishaps is almost certainly groupthink. Multiple authors are the biggest threat to a unified design vision, and every one of these presentations almost certainly had a half-dozen authors and editors. Every one of those authors wants to have their say, and that say is almost always to add something instead of subtract. The result is often a disorganized, distracting and incoherent mess. For an example in the outside world, look at the list of writers on any of the huge disorganized Hollywood blockbuster-flops of the past decade.

It's easy to sit back on a design high-horse and laugh at the weaknesses in these presentations. The painful reality is that these are just people trying to do their jobs the best they can. They don't have experts advising them, and even if they did, they probably don't have the time to listen.

These officers are doing about as good a job at design as most designers would do at the controls of a modern warplane. I say that not to excuse anything, but to place these very different skill sets in the proper perspective. Outstanding information design takes as much talent, training, and practice to perfect as a safe landing on an aircraft carrier at night. It's optimistic to expect people to excel in both fields.

The temptation, of course, is to say that one field is more difficult, important, or dangerous than the other. That &ndash; like the bullets on so many artless PowerPoint decks out there &ndash; would be a grave oversimplification.
