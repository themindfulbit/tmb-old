[Gabe Weatherhead](http://macdrifter.com) was generous enough to have me on [Generational](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/), his weekly podcast on the [70Decibels](http://www.70decibels.com/) network. 

[Generational 025 - Design and Fighter Jets](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/3/10/025-design-and-fighter-jets.html)

The episode hit the streets yesterday afternoon, and if you tune in (wow, that's an out of date phrase) you can hear us chat about deep career shifts, why everything is about compromise, how websites are like airplanes, why the F4F Wildcat was better in the all right ways than the A6M Zero, and the value of a driving personality for all sorts of design projects.

It was a ton of fun to record, and I hope you enjoy it too.
