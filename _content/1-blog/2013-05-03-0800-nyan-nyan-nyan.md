Our long national nightmare is over. We finally have a legal definition of [Nyan Cat](http://www.nyan.cat/original.php).

> As the complaint describes it, Nyan Cat is "a character with a cat's face and a body resembling a horizontal breakfast bar with pink frosting sprinkled with light red dots" that "flies across the screen, leaving a stream of exhaust in the form of a bright rainbow in its wake."

I'll just leave this here. You're welcome.
