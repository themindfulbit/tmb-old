The [Nook HD and HD+](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/nook/379003208) have added Google Play compatibility, meaning they're now full-fledged Android tablets, at least from an app perspective. I believe that even means you can load the [Kindle App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.kindle&hl=en) if you're already stuck in that ecosystem like me. 

If I'm not mistaken, the [Nook HD](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/Compare-NOOKs/379003181) has the only 7" retina-class display on the market right now (1440x900 at 243 ppi) at a fairly compelling price ($199 - $229). I played with one at the store a few weeks ago and liked what I saw, even if this latest generation has had [some growing pains](http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3571394/barnes-noble-nook-hd-review).

I owned a [Nook Color](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nook_Color) and loved it. The thing was incredibly hackable, and its built-in OS lasted about ten seconds before I replaced it with [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/). That early Nook convinced me of the viability of the 7" tablet form factor&mdash;it was pocketable, could be held in one hand, and was tantalizingly close to the [digital kneeboard](http://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-in-real-life-erik-hess-f-5n-tiger-ii-pilot/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+macstoriesnet+%28MacStories%29) I'd always dreamed of. It was also a good introduction to Android on a tablet before Honeycomb optimized it for larger screens.

It's a shame that Barnes & Noble locked the next generations down with so much DRM that the modding community lost interest. I know that the bookseller wanted it to be a loss-leader for their digital media business, but the Nook has always been a worthy device in its own right, even if the software never quite lived up to the hardware design. 

I guess Barnes & Noble had to decide who they wanted to compete with, Apple or Amazon. I don't know that I'd be comfortable choosing either.
