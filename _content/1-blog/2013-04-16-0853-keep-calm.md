Another reality check from [Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/).

> Terrorism, even the terrorism of radical Islamists and right-wing extremists and lone actors all put together, is not an "existential threat" against our nation. Even the events of 9/11, as horrific as they were, didn't do existential damage to our nation. Our society is more robust than it might seem from watching the news. We need to start acting that way. 

Nothing can take away from the tragedy of yesterday's events. We should mourn and remember the three dead and 176 wounded in yesterday's cowardly bombings. We should keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.

But as we move forward and consider what (if any) changes need to be made to our laws, foreign policy, and security procedures in the wake of this tragedy, we also should keep in mind that approximately 312,780,600 Americans *were not* killed or injured in terrorist attacks yesterday or at any other time in the last few years.

Terrorists of any kind (foreign and domestic) feed off our fears. Don't let them win.
