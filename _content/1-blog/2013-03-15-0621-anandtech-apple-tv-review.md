AnandTech has published another of their typically thorough reviews, this time on the latest iteration of the Apple TV and its minor CPU tweak.

> It could very well be that Apple is finally selling enough Apple TVs to warrant a custom A5 of its own rather than continue to ship die harvested A5s from iPhones/iPads. The problem with relying exclusively on die harvesting is that eventually, as yields improve, you end up selling fully functional (and unnecessarily expensive) silicon into a market that’s unwilling to pay for the added performance. 

That first sentence made me think. Are they finally selling enough to warrant the custom chip, *or do they expect to sell a whole lot more of them really soon?*

Time will tell.
