> Bob VanderClay returns to discuss the ultimate topic for Technical Difficulties: Home Automation. We touch on several popular tools, including Hue, SmartThings, WeMo, and Nest.

Gabe and I were thrilled to have [Bob VanderClay](http://takitapart.com) return for his [second](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/032-blogging-platforms-with-bob-vanderclay) appearance on our show.

In addition to being a great friend and my business partner at high90, I've watched the evolution of Bob's home automation system first-hand. He's tried just about everything that's out there and was the perfect guest for this very imperfect topic.
