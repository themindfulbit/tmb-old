This week's episode of [Technical Difficulties](http://technicaldifficulties.us) tackles Sonos. You should totally check out the show notes &ndash; [@potatowire](http://twitter.com/potatowire) outdid himself this week.

> Erik and Gabe go toe-to-toe over the Sonos Wireless sound system. Erik thinks it's expensive but worth it. Gabe thinks it's expensive and worthless. Who wins? You judge.
