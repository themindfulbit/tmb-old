Gabe and I were lucky enough to have [Myke Hurley](http://mykehurley.net/) of [70Decibels](http://www.70decibels.com/) fame grace us with his presence this week. We chatted about how he got into podcasting in the first place, where he plans to go from here now that the 5by5 merger is underway, and how to successfully start a career doing what you love.
