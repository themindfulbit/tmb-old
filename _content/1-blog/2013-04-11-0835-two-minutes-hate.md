summary: "It seems there's a new storm of internet outrage every day. The target could be anyone. You could be loved one minute, and that love can be used as a justification for anger against you the next. The reasons people are angry are often valid, but after a while those reasons don't  seem like they're that important any more. "

There are a couple of good takes on the Saga, Comixology, and Apple rage hangover. 

Macdrifter [has one](http://macdrifter.com/2013/04/internet-froth-again.html). Daniel Jalkut [has another](http://bitsplitting.org/2013/04/11/check-your-libel/):

> Itâ€™s extremely upsetting when a damaging claim turns out to have been false. We need to be outraged by this, or the whole system of fact-based accountability breaks down. As mad as you or I or anybody else may have been about the alleged misdeed by Apple, we should be at least as mad that we were misled to believe it was true.

It seems there's a new storm of internet outrage every day. The target could be anyone. You could be loved one minute, and that love can be used as a justification for anger against you the next. The reasons people are angry are often valid, but after a while those reasons don't  seem like they're that important any more. 

It's almost as if people are already deeply angry and looking for an outlet&mdash;any outlet. Whenever it hits I'm reminded of this passage from [Nineteen Eighty-Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four):

> The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.

Sadly, that sounds like a lot of the discourse on the internet to me.
