Adobe has purchased the online typography and font service [Typekit][1]. The [press release][2] has just appeared on their website.

As a heavy user of Typekit (and Adobe products for that matter) I'm a little nervous. Typekit is dead simple to use and far more affordable than purchasing rights on a font-by-font basis.

Adobe has a lot of great fonts to offer, but "simple" and "affordable" are not words that immediately spring to mind where their products are concerned.

Here's hoping that's about to change.
