A new supernova has appeared in the galaxy [M74](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_74). 

New is relative of course, since M74 is around 30 million light years away. That puts the date of the explosion a little less than half-way between the present and the end of the dinosaurs.

A [probable](http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=5229) [progenitor](http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=5230) star has already been found using archival imagery from the [Hubble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) and [Spitzer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Space_Telescope) Space Telescopes. It sounds like it was an M-type [red supergiant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_supergiant), which is consistent with the data indicating a [Type II supernova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova).

A light curve showing the evolution of the supernova's brightness is being updated regularly on the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) [event page](http://www.aavso.org/lcg/plot?auid=000-BLC-552&starname=SN%202013EJ&lastdays=30&start=&stop=2456527.06134&obscode=&obscode_symbol=2&obstotals=yes&calendar=calendar&forcetics=&grid=on&visual=on&r=on&bband=on&v=on&pointsize=1&width=800&height=450&mag1=&mag2=&mean=&vmean=).

I've always found supernovae fascinating. That something so large, powerful and long-lasting as a star can die so violently is a clear reminder that *everything* changes in the universe. Yet events of this magnitude are [the forge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_nucleosynthesis) where nearly every critical element to modern society is created.

This marks the third supernova in M74 over the last eleven years. You can find more detail and a slightly-vertigo-inducing before-and-after animation on the [Remanzacco Observatory's confirmation post](http://remanzacco.blogspot.com/2013/07/supernova-2013ej-in-m74.html).
