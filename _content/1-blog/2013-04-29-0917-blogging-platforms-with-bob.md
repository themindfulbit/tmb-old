On this week's episode of [Generational](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/) Gabe and I geeked out about blogging platforms with [Bob&nbsp;VanderClay](http://takitapart.com/), my business partner at [high90](http://high90.com). 

We covered a lot of topics in an hour and forty-five minutes, as clearly seen by the epic length of our show notes. Bob has been developing websites professionally for nearly fifteen years, and had some great perspective on how website technology has evolved, where we are today, and where we're going in the future. 

On the show we compared Blogging-as-a-Service (BaaS) to self-hosted blogging, then dove into the advantages and disadvantages of static, dynamic, and hybrid blogging engines. Along the way, we touched on templating languages, commenting, writing tools, hosting providers, and backups. 

It was a real pleasure having Bob on this week, and if these topics seem interesting I hope you give the show a listen.
