[Bob VanderClay](http://twitter.com/takitapart) has been my business partner at [high90](http://high90.com) since 2006, and we've been friends for over a decade. Posts like this remind me of a quote from Lord of the Rings:

> "My dear Frodo!" exclaimed Gandalf. "Hobbits really are amazing creatures... You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch."

Bob's shiny new blog [Takitapart](http://takitapart.com) is built on [DocPad](http://docpad.org). Check it out.
