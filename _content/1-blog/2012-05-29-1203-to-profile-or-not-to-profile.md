[To Profile or Not to Profile? - A Debate between Sam Harris and Bruce Schneier][3]

   [3]: http://www.schneier.com/essay-397.html

While I firmly believe that finding the balance between liberty and security is one of the most difficult and important issues of our time, that's not why you should read this essay. You should read it because two _gentlemen_ are expressing different opinions on an extremely sensitive and complicated issue _respectfully_ and _rationally_.

_On the internet._

To highlight:

  * Complicated issues
  * Differing perspectives
  * Nuanced and well-supported arguments
  * Reason
  * Respect

Whatever your intellectual, political or moral position, I hope we can all agree on one thing: 

_We need more public discourse like this._
