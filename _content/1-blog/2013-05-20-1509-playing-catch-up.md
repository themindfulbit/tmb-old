I've been swamped for the past week and a half. First it was a short trip to [June Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Lake,_California) then I followed it up with a tight work deadline. Here's my chance to catch up on a few awesome things that happened while I was mindlessly preoccupied in the shadow of the Sierra.

### Generational 34 - Developing Workflow Software with Greg Pierce

Gabe and I were stoked to have [Greg Pierce](https://twitter.com/agiletortoise) of [Agile Tortoise](http://agiletortoise.com/) on Generational a couple of weeks ago. The way Greg and other developers have wrung inter-app communication out of iOS still amazes me, and I couldn't go a day without using [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) on my iPhone. The show is one of my favorites, so [give it a listen](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/5/11/034-developing-workflow-software-with-greg-pierce.html).

### Generational 35 - Information Capture and Recall with Bradley Chambers

[On our next show](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/5/18/035-information-capture-and-recall-with-bradley-chambers.html) we dove into information capture with the talented [Bradley Chambers](https://twitter.com/bradleychambers) of [Chambers Daily](http://chambersdaily.com/) and the [Out of School](http://outofschool.net/) podcast. Bradley took us through his Evernote workflow and as the show progressed I got to reexamine a lot of the ways I use the service. He also announced his latest project&mdash;[Learning to Love Evernote](http://lovingevernote.com/)&mdash;a series of screencasts on how to unlock the power of Evernote in your daily life. Check it out.

### I'm Hooke'd on Dr. Drang

A couple of days ago, [Dr. Drang](https://twitter.com/drdrang) followed up on our [inflammatory episode](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/5/4/033-what-happened-when-gabe-set-himself-on-fire.html) about the joys and dangers of experimentation. In his informative and heartwarming manner, he tells how his son learned about strain energy from a master:

> “You need to move around to the other side,” I said.

> “Why?”

> “Because when I cut through, these screws are going to shoot out like bullets, and you’re standing in the way.”

> “Really?” I should mention that my son is sixteen years old and therefore assumes that I’m full of shit. But he moved anyway.

The post&mdash;["Now We See the Violence Inherent in Hooke's Law"](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/05/now-we-see-the-violence-inherent-in-hookes-law/)&mdash;is exactly as awesome as you would expect. 

While you're visiting, you should read his post about the water tower scene in Iron Man III&mdash;[Steel in Extremis](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/05/steel-in-extremis/). The charts alone are worth a look, especially if you've got superhuman steel-melting abilities. 

*I have a hard time watching military or aviation movies for the same reason, Doc.*

### A Marked improvement in CriticMarkup

Finally, the ever-talented [Brett Terpstra](https://twitter.com/ttscoff) has tweaked [CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com/) so it works well with the current version of [Marked](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?mt=12), my go-to app for Markdown composition on the Mac.

The best part is that you can now play with our nifty three-pane edit view which was previously accessible to only Marked beta testers. Brett has the details on how to set the whole thing up [over at his blog](http://brettterpstra.com/2013/05/18/criticmarkup-in-marked-1-dot-4/).
