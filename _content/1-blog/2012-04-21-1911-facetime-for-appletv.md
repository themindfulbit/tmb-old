Another major holiday has passed, and once again I plead:

> Dear Apple,
> 
> Please make a FaceTime camera for the Apple TV. I will buy two for my house, and then I'll buy one for everybody in my family. If necessary I'll buy them a new Apple TV as well.
> 
> Happy Easter, The Mindful Bit

I've hooked and unhooked my laptop to my TV for family holiday videochats a dozen times. It's always complicated (well beyond the technical reach of the average family) and seems so wasteful when there's already an AppleTV attached and ready to go.

In theory I could try screen sharing from an iPad or iPhone, but the audio latency is a killer and there's no good place to put the phone so it keeps a steady field of view.

My family is a bit less tech-savvy and instead they huddle around their iPhone, iPad, laptop or desktop, struggling to share the camera's tiny field of view and listen to their loved ones' voices through a tiny, tinny speaker.

_What if everybody could just sit on their couch and talk like normal people instead, on the biggest display and through best stereo they own?_

We know the 3rd Gen Apple TV has Bluetooth and WiFi. We know it's got a powerful enough processor and that it runs a version of iOS. Apple TV FaceTime _has_ to be technically possible. A simple wireless webcam couldn't be a huge stretch for Apple's talented hardware folks. A TV-based app that brings free, simple video calling to the parents and grandparents of the world can't be much more of a challenge to the iOS software team.

A hypothetical FaceTime capability for Apple TV would make a huge positive impact on my family, and I'm sure it would do the same for all those with loved ones scattered across the country and world.

I sure wish I could buy a ton of them in time for Christmas.
