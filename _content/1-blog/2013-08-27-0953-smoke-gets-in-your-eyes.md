Carson City has been downwind of the [Rim Fire](http://www.inciweb.org/incident/3660/) outside Yosemite since it began ten days ago. We've been shrouded in an eerie, choking cloud of smoke since then and it's made everything in our fair city look a bit apocalyptic.

Through the smoke, the sun gives off only a faint red glow and is dim enough to look at without sunglasses (but *don't do that*).

NASA has recently released a few images that really bring out the magnitude of the fire and its associated smoke plume. First is a shot taken from the International Space Station by Astronaut [Karen Nyberg](https://twitter.com/AstroKarenN/status/372105386204999680). Carson City is the red circle.

Another interesting image is from the [Suomi NPP](http://npp.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html) satellite. Carson City is the blob of light at the tip of the red arrow.

Both my wife and two-year-old son are sick with bronchitis, so we left for the clean skies of Sacramento this weekend. It was a bit difficult to come back to the smoke yesterday. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. This is the first natural catastrophe that has had a real impact on my life, and it has been a bit eye-watering (pun *certainly* intended).

Hopefully the fire gets under control before too much more damage occurs, but  wildfires can be a necessary part of many forest ecosystems. I just hope this one resulted from natural causes.
