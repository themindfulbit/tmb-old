My friends Gabe Weatherhead and Jeff Hunsberger just released their beautiful new beer journaling app [TapCellar](http://tapcellar.com/) on the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tapcellar-beer-finder-check/id895045917?ls=1&mt=8).

They've been working on this one for a long time and it shows. The design is clean and refined, everything an app should be in the post-iOS 7 era. 

I particularly like their use of color. It's easy for app designers to let accent colors get out of control in this new era (Reminders.app I'm looking at *you*) but Gabe and Jeff chose a subtle beer-tinted palette and made smart decisions on highlight placement in a way that really sets TapCellar apart from other apps.

I used to live in a state that was behind the times as far as craft beer was concerned. Now that I'm free I've spent a lot more time looking for *good* beer as opposed to just trying to find *drinkable* beer.

I'm sure TapCellar will come in handy as I keep exploring. 

Give it a try.
