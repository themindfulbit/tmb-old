I've been using [Sublime Text 2][2] for my coding needs recently, and it's rapidly become my primary text editor on the Mac.

[Macdrifter][3] just posted a [link][4] on Twitter to the below article from net tuts+. It's got a bunch of useful Sublime Text 2 plugins and extensions. The Git extension looks extremely useful.

When you're done, be sure to check out [Macdrifter's site][5] for a ridiculous number of highly useful hacks. If you've ever considered using [Keyboard Maestro][6], you should also listen to his [guest appearance][7] on the Mac Power Users podcast with David Sparks and Katie Floyd.

Beware though - his personal site is one of those where you visit looking for something specific and end up reading everything he's ever posted.

You have been warned.
