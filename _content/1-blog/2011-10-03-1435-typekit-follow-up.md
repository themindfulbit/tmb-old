> Bloated is the best adjective to describe Adobe products. It really irks me that Adobe Reader is the industry standard when it is pretty much the worst PDF editor available.

I hope that this acquisition is more like when Intuit acquired Mint. Mint stayed the same but got more resources. Intuit's own products improved, if only slightly.

We'll see how this pans out.
