> You love a lot of things if you live around them, but there isn’t any woman and there isn’t any horse, nor any before nor any after, that is as lovely as a great airplane, and men who love them are faithful to them even though they leave them for others.

> A man has only one virginity to lose in fighters, and if it is a lovely plane he loses it to, there his heart will ever be.
