epigram: 'You love a lot of things if you live around them, but there isn’t any woman and there isn’t any horse, nor any before nor any after, that is as lovely as a great airplane, and men who love them are faithful to them even though they leave them for others.<br/><br/>A man has only one virginity to lose in fighters, and if it is a lovely plane he loses it to, there his heart will ever be.'
epi-cite: 'Ernest Hemingway, [London Fights the Robots](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684839059/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=theminbit-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0684839059)<br/>**Collier’s**, August 19, 1944'
