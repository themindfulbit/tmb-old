If you follow [Gabe Weatherhead](http://www.twitter.com/macdrifter) at [Macdrifter](http://macdrifter.com), you might have seen his big announcement today. Gabe has developed a new site-specific search engine called [NerdQuery](http://nerdquery.com) and he was generous enough to let me help out with the design. 

NerdQuery's job is to help nerds like us find useful things by searching a high-signal/low-noise sandbox of the best nerd blogs in existence. Knowing the site's mission and target audience, I set out to create a design that maximized speed and simplicity. 

When Gabe sent me the link to his test installation, the site was using a default theme called "Pure".

Rather than try to adapt the original theme, I decided to start with a clean-slate. What follows is a quick discussion of how the site's colors, icons and typography evolved.

### Iconography

My first task was to create a memorable color scheme and icon. Once that was done, many of the site's other design decisions would naturally emerge. I really like the muted palette Gabe uses on his website, particularly the light-gray backdrop, slate-blue metadata, and beautiful crimson-bordered header by [Aaron Mahnke](https://twitter.com/amahnke) of [Wet Frog Studios](http://www.wetfrogstudios.com/).

The design wouldn't work if NerdQuery looked too much like the Macdrifter site, but I felt they should at least look like siblings.

With the help of a handy app named [Color Schemer Studio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/colorschemer-studio/id417896628?mt=12), I created a muted palette of grays, blues and reds that would hopefully be easy on the eyes of the site's users.

The logo itself went through a few iterations. The URL we used for the test site was 

`http://super.nerdquery.com` 

and I immediately (and incorrectly) started thinking we would call the final site *Super NerdQuery*. Of course the next thing out of my brain was some kind of superhero logo. 

Afraid of going too far down that rabbit hole, I wanted to balance things with a font that was totally counter to typical Superman-style design. For some crazy reason *Bauhaus 93* jumped out at me.

Mash those two silly ideas together and you get this:

{{ theme:partial src="image" file="supernerd.png" }}

Aside from the distortion and an extended pointed tail on the Q, it's straight Bauhaus. Around that time I found out that "super" was just the subdomain, and that the final site's name would be NerdQuery. 

We'd probably want the full name somewhere, so I tried this:

{{ theme:partial src="image" file="widenerd.png" }}

Unbalanced, awkward and uninspiring.

The direction at the time *clearly* wasn't working, so I drastically simplified things. Keeping the only element that stuck in my brain, I threw away everything but the Qâ€”which doubled as a list-bullet and search-style magnifying glass.

### Typography

If the title wasn't going to be in the graphical header, then I knew I'd better find a good font I could extend to all the headers in the site. 

Keeping the technical bent of the target audience in mind, I was drawn to monospace fonts. [Typekit](http://typekit.com) has a lot of options, but one that really stood out was [Mono45 Headline](http://www.europatype.com/articledetail/16) by [EuropaType](http://www.europatype.com/).

Early on, Gabe let me know that our audience would consist of a lot of Apple nerds. I wanted an elegant sans-serif body font that would look comfortably familiar, and there was only one choice (assuming I skipped Helvetica): Myriad Pro. 

I was very happy how it turned out, although I'm going to have to watch and make sure it doesn't look too cliched over time.

### It's a Journey

Next chance I get, I'll address layout and structure. There were some challenges with the PHP/HTML of the core template which required some deep and non-backward-compatible rework. Until that post gets written, enjoy NerdQuery and let me know if you have any comments, questions or suggestions.
