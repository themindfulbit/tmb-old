My wife and I went to see *Man of Steel* last night.

After the movie ended I was leaving the restroom and squeezed past a group of older teens who had left the movie just behind us. They were standing in a circle outside the restroom door, alternately squealing and pointing at the ground.

"Look at that gross spider! It's so big!"

Frozen on the tile floor in the middle of the group was an average-sized garden spider, well out of its element.

*"Kill it!"* one of the girls said. 

In response, one of the boys stood up from where he kneeled over the spider, casually squashed it with his boot, then walked into the bathroom. 

The group dispersed.

I'm not sure if I was sadder that they'd missed the point of the movie, or that I didn't do anything to stop them.
